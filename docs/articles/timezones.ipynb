    "# Working with timezones\n",
    "\n",
    "Timestamp data can be timezone-naíve or timezone-aware. Using timestamped data with *staircase* has been a feature since the inception of the package, however the ability to work with timezone-aware date was only introduced in v1.6.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many time-based applications of staircase it may suffice to ignore the concept of timezones and work with timezone-naíve data - an attractive option as working with timezones, and converting between them, can be tricky.  However many countries observe [Daylight Savings Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) which results in one day of the year having 23 hours, and another having 25 hours.  Now if you are computing some daily metric and do not take this into account then the calculations on those days will be incorrect, however the consequences, and indeed the calculated result, could well be immaterial.  However, that would be a lazy excuse for not implementing timezone support in staircase, and indeed for some applications the use of timezone-aware timestamps may be critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the sheer number of packages available for Python it may be of no surprise that there are several for dealing with timezones however there is one which is clearly the de facto standard: [pytz](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/).  We will demonstrate the use of Pytz in this article, however staircase supports any timezone package that [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) supports."
