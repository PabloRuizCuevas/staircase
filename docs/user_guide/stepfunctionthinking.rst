Thinking in step functions
===========================

* a lot tend to be time based - which represents a change in state.
* simplest is boolean - on vs off, true vs false, in vs out.  Taking means.  At work vs not at work.
*  In vs out = queue of 1.  Extend to whole of queue.
* count - non decreasing goes up by one each time - useful for success rates

* value of your bank account


* jobs with money associated.


* don't have to be time based
