In this example we have a number of vessels (i.e. ships) which arrive offshore and await their turn to enter a harbour where they will be loaded with cargo.  We will examine the queue, which is composed of all vessels which are offshore but yet to enter the harbour, for the year 2020.\n",

The first column gives the time at which the vessel arrives offshore (enters the queue), and the second column gives the time at which the vessel enters the harbour (leaves the queue).  A [NaT](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html#datetimes) value in either of these columns indicates the vessel entered the queue prior to 2020, or left the queue after 2020, however this approach does not require these values to be NaT.  The third column gives the weight of cargo destined for the vessel.  Note, for the staircase approach to work we require every vessel, that was in the queue at some point in 2020, to appear in the dataframe."
